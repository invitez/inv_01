## ✨ About  

RetroVite is a playful, pixel-art invitation designed for fun virtual meetups.  
It’s a personal project, my very first website, built to invite a friend for a casual **Google Meet hangout**—but with style!  

Inspired by **classic retro aesthetics**, it features animated elements, floating effects, and a nostalgic vibe to make every invite special.
